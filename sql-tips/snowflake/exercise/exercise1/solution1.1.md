# How to with pyspark
You don't need to explicitly partition the table when using PySpark! That's one of the main advantages of PySpark -
it handles data partitioning and parallel processing automatically. Let me show you a simpler and more efficient
approach:

Key advantages of this approach:

1. **Automatic Parallelization**:
    - PySpark automatically handles data partitioning
    - Each operation is parallelized across available executors
    - No need for manual partition management

2. **Simplified Process**:
    - No need to create and manage temporary tables
    - Single write operation at the end
    - Cleaner, more maintainable code

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
    - Only loads relevant data (where effective_date > 2022-10-01)
    - Caches data in memory for multiple operations
    - Uses Spark's built-in optimization engine

4. **Efficient Memory Usage**:
    - No data duplication across partitions
    - Better resource utilization
    - Automatic memory management

To optimize for your 160GB dataset:

1. **Tune these parameters based on your cluster**:
   ```python
   .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")  # Adjust based on data size
   .config("spark.executor.memory", "16g")         # Adjust based on available memory
   ```

2. **For better performance, you could**:
    - Increase executor memory if available
    - Adjust the number of shuffle partitions
    - Use a larger Snowflake warehouse during the operation

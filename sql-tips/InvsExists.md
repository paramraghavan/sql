Not exactly. Let me explain when to use IN vs EXISTS with a clear performance consideration:

```sql
-- General rule:
-- Use EXISTS when the subquery returns many rows
-- Use IN when the subquery returns a small set of unique values

-- Example 1: Better with IN (small result set in subquery)
SELECT customer_name 
FROM customers 
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE total_amount > 10000
);

-- Same query with EXISTS (less efficient for small subquery)
SELECT customer_name 
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
    AND o.total_amount > 10000
);

-- Example 2: Better with EXISTS (large result set in subquery)
SELECT product_name
FROM products p
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_details od
    WHERE od.product_id = p.product_id
    AND od.quantity > 100
);

-- Same query with IN (less efficient for large subquery)
SELECT product_name
FROM products
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM order_details
    WHERE quantity > 100
);

-- Key Performance Considerations:
-- 1. IN creates a temporary result set with all values
-- 2. EXISTS stops as soon as it finds a match
-- 3. IN requires unique values (removes duplicates)
-- 4. EXISTS can work with multiple columns in correlation

```

The actual rule is:

1. Use EXISTS when:
    - The subquery returns many rows
    - There are duplicate values in the subquery
      - You need to correlate multiple columns
    ```sql
       SELECT * 
        FROM orders o
        WHERE EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 
              FROM order_details od
              JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
              WHERE od.order_id = o.order_id              -- First correlation
              AND p.category = 'Electronics'              -- Additional condition
              AND od.unit_price * od.quantity = o.total_amount  -- Second correlation
        );
    ```
    - Early termination is possible (EXISTS stops at first match)

2. Use IN when:
    - The subquery returns a small, unique set of values
    - The subquery results can be effectively cached
    - You're matching against a single column
    - The outer query is larger than the subquery

Additional tips:

- NOT EXISTS is usually more efficient than NOT IN
- IN can be problematic with NULL values
- Consider replacing both with JOIN when appropriate

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of these patterns in more detail?

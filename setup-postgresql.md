# Database Servers

Docker compose will run all needed development databases locally. 
A `docker-compose.yml` file has been provided. To startup the containerized local development environment, run:

> **Pre-requisite**:
>> You should have docker installed. If you are like me and using windows as your development enviroment
>> use this [link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) to install docker desktop
>>> Using docker command  *'docker compose up'* to deploy multiple containers defined in docker-compose.yml
> 
> > 
> **Containers defined in postgresql:**
>> postgresql_postgres - the postgresql db instance, postgresql_postgres - the postgresql client ui  
> 
> Docker containers to be started - postgresql_postgres and postgresql_admin


> **What is docker compose**
>> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file
> to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration 

> Using sql driver psycopg2 and pymongo
>> pip install psycopg2
> 
>>  pip install pymongo

- cd ./postgresql

## postgresql
- creates a postgresql container

```
cd ./postgresql
docker compose up
Above creates a containerized instance of postgresql database, creates students table and adds data to this table.
```

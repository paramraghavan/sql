# Answer

Here's how it works:

1. **Data Partitioning:**
    - Uses HASH and MOD functions to evenly distribute rows across 4 temporary tables
    - Each temp table will get approximately 25% of the filtered data
    - The partitioning is based on a hash of the ID column(identified as key column(s) to ensure even distribution

2. **Parallel Processing:**
    - You can run updates on each temp table independently
    - Snowflake will handle these operations in parallel
    - Each update can be run in a separate transaction if needed

3. **Final Merge:**
    - Combines all updated data back into the main history table
    - Uses a MERGE statement to handle the updates efficiently
    - Includes a last_updated timestamp for tracking

Some important considerations:

1. Replace `id` with your actual primary key column name
2. Adjust the `column1`, `column2` fields with your actual column names
3. Modify the update conditions based on your specific requirements
4. You might want to add appropriate transaction handling
5. Consider adding error handling and logging
